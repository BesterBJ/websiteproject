Software Project Assessment Guideline for BTech Students

You have organised yourselves into groups and started working on your end of year project. The First and most important thing is that you shall need to
present a working project at the end of next Month.

In addition to a working Project, the your software will be assessed based on sustainability, maintainability, and usability using a criteria-based
assessment which gives a measurement of quality in a number of areas. These areas are derived from ISO/IEC 9126-1 Software engineering â€” Product
quality 1 and include usability, sustainability and maintainability.

The assessment involves checking whether your software, and the project that develops it, conforms to various characteristics or exhibits various
qualities that are expected of sustainable software.

Below is the list metrics that will be used. Not ALL of the ISO/IEC 9126-1 metrics are included.
Please note that this is a lot of work and it is important that you make use of your group dynamics to allocate resources to the task of complying with
this.
